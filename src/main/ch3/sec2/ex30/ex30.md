3.2.30 _Order check._ Write a recursive method `isOrdered()` that takes a Node and two keys min and max as arguments and returns true if all the keys in the tree are between min and max; min and max are indeed the smallest and largest keys in the tree, respectively; and the BST ordering property holds for all keys in the tree; false otherwise.
